## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is an AI-powered coding assistant built by coollabsio. It supports over 20 AI providers, includes built-in browser automation, and integrates with chat platforms like Telegram, Discord, Slack, and WhatsApp.

## Authentication

OpenClaw uses HTTP Basic Auth. The `AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD` environment variables are auto-generated by Coolify during deployment.

A gateway token (`OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) is also generated for API access.

## AI Providers

At least one AI provider API key is required. Set the corresponding environment variable for your provider:

- **Anthropic** — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- **OpenAI** — `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Google Gemini** — `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- **OpenRouter** — `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- **Groq** — `GROQ_API_KEY`
- **Mistral** — `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
- **xAI** — `XAI_API_KEY`
- **Cerebras** — `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`
- **Amazon Bedrock** — `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`
- **Ollama (local)** — `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`

Use `OPENCLAW_PRIMARY_MODEL` to set the default model.

For the full list of supported providers and configuration options, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coollabsio/openclaw?utm_source=coolify.io).

## Browser

The `/browser` endpoint opens a remote browser controlled by OpenClaw via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). This is useful for OAuth flows, 2FA, captcha solving, and authenticated web scraping.

Browser sessions are persisted across restarts via a dedicated volume. You can configure the browser with these environment variables:

- `BROWSER_DEFAULT_PROFILE` — Browser profile name (default: `openclaw`)
- `BROWSER_SNAPSHOT_MODE` — Snapshot mode (default: `efficient`)
- `BROWSER_EVALUATE_ENABLED` — Enable JavaScript evaluation (default: `true`)
