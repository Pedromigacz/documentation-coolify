## What is Linkding?

Linkding is a minimalist, self-hosted bookmark manager that focuses on simplicity and performance. It provides a clean interface for saving, organizing, and searching your bookmarks.

## Different Versions of Linkding

Linkding is available in two versions:

| Version         | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `latest`        | Provides the basic functionality of linkding |
| `plus`          | Includes feature for archiving websites as HTML snapshots. Note: This version has a significantly larger image size as it includes a Chromium installation, requires more runtime memory to run Chromium, and requires more disk space for storing HTML snapshots |
