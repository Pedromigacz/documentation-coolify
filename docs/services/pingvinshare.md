## What is PingvinShare?

PingvinShare is a self-hosted file sharing platform that combines lightness and beauty. It allows you to easily share files with others through temporary links, supports password protection, expiration dates, and provides a clean, modern interface. PingvinShare is designed to be a lightweight alternative to commercial file sharing services while giving you complete control over your data.
