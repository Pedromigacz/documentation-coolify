## What is TrailBase?

An open, blazingly fast, single-executable Firebase alternative with type-safe REST & realtime APIs, built-in WebAssembly runtime, SSR, auth and admin UI built on Rust, SQLite & Wasmtime.

Simplify with fewer moving parts: an easy to self-host single-executable with everything you need to focus on your mobile, web or desktop application. Sub-millisecond latencies eliminate the need for dedicated caches, no more stale or inconsistent data.
