## What is Siyuan?

Siyuan is a privacy-first personal knowledge management system that supports complete offline usage, as well as end-to-end encrypted data sync. Built with TypeScript and Golang, it offers a unique block-based approach to note-taking that combines the flexibility of outlines with the power of bidirectional linking.

The platform enables you to organize your thoughts and information using interconnected blocks, making it easy to build a comprehensive personal knowledge base. With features like local-first storage, end-to-end encryption, and cross-platform synchronization, Siyuan ensures your data remains private and accessible across all your devices.
