## What is Langflow?

Langflow is an open-source Python-based framework for building AI applications. It combines a visual authoring experience with full programmatic access, enabling teams to prototype, test, and deploy AI-powered agents and workflows.

It accelerates development by providing a **drag-and-drop interface** while maintaining the flexibility of **custom Python components** for advanced use cases.
