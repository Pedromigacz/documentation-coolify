## What is SFTPGo?

SFTPGo is an event-driven file transfer solution. It support multiple protocols (SFTP, SCP, FTP/S, WebDAV, HTTP/S) and multiple storage backends.

With SFTPGo you can leverage local and cloud storage backends for exchanging and storing files internally or with business partners using the same tools and processes you are already familiar with.

The WebAdmin UI allows to easily create and manage your users, folders, groups and other resources.
