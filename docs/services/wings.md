## What is Wings?

Wings is Pterodactyl's server control plane, built for the rapidly changing gaming industry and designed to be highly performant and secure. Wings provides an HTTP API allowing you to interface directly with running server instances, fetch server logs, generate backups, and control all aspects of the server lifecycle.

In addition, Wings ships with a built-in SFTP server allowing your system to remain free of Pterodactyl specific dependencies, and allowing users to authenticate with the same credentials they would normally use to access the Panel.
